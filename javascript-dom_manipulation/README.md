# JavaScript DOM Manipulation

## Description

This project focuses on practicing **JavaScript** for manipulating the **DOM (Document Object Model)**. You will learn how to interact with HTML elements dynamically through scripts ‚Äî changing styles, updating content, handling events, and making network requests.

This project is part of the **Holberton School curriculum** and was manually reviewed by peers to ensure code quality and understanding.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Select HTML elements using JavaScript
- Understand the differences between ID, class, and tag name selectors
- Modify an element‚Äôs style and content
- Dynamically update the DOM
- Use `XMLHttpRequest` and `Fetch API` to make network requests
- Listen and respond to DOM and user events

---

## Requirements

- Use `document.querySelector` and other DOM methods appropriately
- Do not use `var` ‚Äî only `const` and `let` are allowed
- HTML should not reload on each action ‚Äî all updates should be made via JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Your scripts must be semi-standard compliant
- JavaScript must be tested on Chrome browser (version 57.0+)
- Each script should be linked to an HTML file for testing
